## What is in this repository?

This is the brain of Cumulonimbus, it's what the end-user talks to when using the frontend, a 3rd party application that uses Cumulonimbus, or a program the end-user configured to upload content to Cumulonimbus. Very little happens on Cumulonimbus without going through this first. Most end-users will not manually interact with this.
